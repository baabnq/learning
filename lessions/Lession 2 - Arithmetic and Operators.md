# Lession 2 - Arithmetic and Operators
Doing math works exactly how you would expect. So i will just give examples for each operator. 
Important to remember is though, that Baabnq doesn't have [unary operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation)  and only has [binary operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation). 
### Addition and Subtraction
```
put _a = 2
put _b = 5;
put _c = _a + _b;
print _c - 3;
```
### Bitwise And
```
print 3 & 5;
```
### Bitwise Or
```
print 3 | 5;
```
### Bitwise Xor
```
print 3 ^ 5;
```
### Shift Right
Shift Right is also referred to as Shift Great because it move in the direction of the [MSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering#Most_significant_bit).
 ```
 print 1 << 3;
```
### Shift Left
Inversely, Shift Left is also referred to as Shift Small for the same reason.
```
print 8 >> 3;
```
