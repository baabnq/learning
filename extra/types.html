See that? ...
There's just a bunch of data there, but what does it mean? ...

And exactly that is the problem:
    <span class="inline-embed">Data on its own doesn't carry any inherent <a>meaning</a>.</span>
    </pre>        

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <pre>
Types.
Types are the solution.
Types ascribe meaning to data, to a sequence of bits.

A type can be anything, 
    it can be machanism of the programming language, 
    it can also be a descriptive text,
    it can just be an interpretation in someones head.
    
As long as it brings meaning to information, 
    it can be (at least conceptually) considered a type.
