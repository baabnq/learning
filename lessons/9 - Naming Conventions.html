    <h1>Lesson 9 - Naming Conventions</h1>
    
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
lab MyModule::Routine;
    put _local = 0;
    new 'example' _sLocalString;
    
    lab MyModule::Routine::OuterScope;
        lab MyModule::Routine::OuterScope::InnerScope;
        
    return;
</pre>

    <p>
        Note that: These conventions are only guidelines and not rigid rules.
        It's generally a good idea to follow these, but you can to whatever you want, i (probably) won't stop you.
    </p>

    <h2>Routines and Sublabels</h2>
    <p>
        Labels in routines always follow this format:
        <br><span class="inline-embed" style="display: inline-block; margin: 10px;">
            <span style="color: yellow;">lab</span>
            <span class="g">&lt;module name&gt;</span>::<span class="g">&lt;routine name&gt;</span>::<span class="g">&lt;sublabel 0&gt;</span>::<span class="g"> ... </span>; 
        </span><br>
        
        This is known as identifier scoping and done because labels, much like variables, 
        have no inherent scope and are globally accessable.<br>
        
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
        Variables often use a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian Notation</a> to indicate their <a href="/learning/extra/types.html">type</a>.
        Variables are prefixed with a shorthand identifier, the most common of which are:
    </p>
    
    <table>
        <tr> <th>Prefix</th> <th>Meaning</th>              <th>Example</th></tr>
        <tr> <td>"s"</td>    <td>string</td>               <td><p class="inline-embed baabnq-source">new 'hello world' _sHello;</p></td></tr>
        <tr> <td>"p"</td>    <td>pointer</td>              <td><p class="inline-embed baabnq-source">static 100 _pBuffer;</p></td></tr>
        <tr> <td>"i"</td>    <td>index</td>                <td><p class="inline-embed baabnq-source">put _iLoop = 0;</p></td></tr>
        <tr> <td>"fp"</td>   <td>floating-point value</td> <td><p class="inline-embed baabnq-source">put _fpValue = _Floats::Zero;</p></td></tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
        While variables are also all scopeless, they are almost always only used locally.
        As such, they usually don't use identifier scoping.
        The arising problem of <a href="">variable collision</a> between different routines and modules is solved through <a href="">variable insulation</a>.
        When a variable is, however, is intended for global use, it also uses identifier scoping. See the example above 
        <span class="inline-embed" style="color: cyan;">_Floats::Zero</span>, where this is used for a globally accessable constant, stemming from the floating-point module.
