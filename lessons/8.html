    <p>
        A Routine Signature is a comment that precedes the actual routine and specifies the routine's <a href="/extra/types.html">type</a>.
        It is comprised of two parts: The type signature and the implementation signature.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <h3>Type Signature</h3>
    <p>
        The type signature usually comes first as part of the routine signature and details the in- and out-parameter names along with their types in calling order.
        <br><span class="inline-embed" style="color: gray; margin: 10px; display: inline-block;">(InParam::InType, ...) => (OutParam::OutType, ...)</span><br>
        Parameters are delimited by commas, and the list of them is enclosed in parenthesis. 
        In the parameter, name comes first, then two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(punctuation)">colons</a>, then the type.
    </p>

    <h3>Implementation Signature</h3>
    <p>
        The implementation signature follows after the type signature. It usually consists of either a textual description of the function and working of the routine
        or a parallel implementation of the routine in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">tacit</a> programming language 
        like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> or <a href="https://www.uiua.org/">Uiua</a>.
