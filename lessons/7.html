      I don't intend for this to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121025045227/www.btinternet.com/~btketman/tutpage.html">personal autobiographical</a> or 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIS-100">immersively fictional</a> programmatic learning experience, 
      but i do wish to congratulate you on making it through the core features. Good job, have a cat picture:

    <h4>Now, a bit about the Philosophy of Baabnq</h4>
    <p>
        Baabnq's philosophy is generally one of simplicity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)">minimalism</a>.
        Minimalism not only in the design of the language but also in the practice of using it.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        It tries to avoid the trap of excessive abstraction and overengineering that a lot of modern software falls into.
        Abstraction and related polymorphisms are powerful tools, but they can blind you and distract you from your goal.
        (Hope that didn't sound too religious / self-improvement-ish).
        Baabnq allows the utilization of abstractions, but it actively exposes the mechanisms used to achieve those abstractions.
        This makes the programmer aware of the immediate reality and consequences of their abstraction.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        This philosophy of minimal abstraction also applies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">types</a>.
        Formally, baabnq is an untyped language, meaning that it doesn't provide any build-in features for assigning types to data.
        Now, the formal definition of stuff like that is usually pretty useless to people who don't already know it,
        so here's a (briefly) explanation of what a type is:

        <br>
        <br>
        Basically, data on its own is useless, right? 
        If there is a random string of data, then that data on its own doesn't really <a>mean</a> anything, does it?
        Data on its own doesn't carry any inherent <a>meaning</a>.
        That's where the type comes in. The job of a type is used to ascribe meaning to some information or data.
        For example: <br>
        Is something like <span class="inline-embed">int a;</span> written in a 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages">c-like language</a>,
        then that means that "a" is declared (that's why it's called type declaration) to be of type "int".
        The data stored in "a" is to be understood as an integer. Now, just knowing that "a" is an integer
        doesn't tell us anything about why "a" exists or what its purpose is, but it still makes the data
        stored in "a" more meaningful, and so "int" is a type.
        TLDR: Types give meaning to data.
