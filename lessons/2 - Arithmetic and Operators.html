    <h1>Lesson 2 - Arithmetic and Operators</h1>

    <p>
Doing math works exactly as you would expect. So this here will give brief examples for each operator. 
Important to remember is, though, that Baabnq doesn't have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation">unary operators</a>; it only has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_operation">binary operators</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Addition and Subtraction</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
put _a = 2;
put _b = 5;
put _c = _a + _b;
print _c - 3;
</pre>

    <h3>Bitwise And</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 3 & 5;
</pre>

    <h3>Bitwise Or</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 3 | 5;
</pre>

    <h3>Bitwise Xor</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 3 ^ 5;
</pre>

    <h3>Shift Right</h3>
    <p>
      Shift Right is also referred to as Shift Great because it moves in the direction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering#Most_significant_bit)">MSb</a>.
    </p>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 1 << 3;
</pre>

    <h3>Shift Left</h3>
    <p>
Inversely, Shift Left is also referred to as Shift Small for the same reason.

<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 8 >> 3;
</pre>
