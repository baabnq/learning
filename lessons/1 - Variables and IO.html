    <h1>Lesson 1 - Variables and IO</h1>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
put _a = 100;
put _b = 200;
put _a = _b;
</pre>
    <p>
Variables in Baabnq are always prefixed by an underscore "_" and are always assigned with the "put" command. 
However, they are not declared but inferred by the compiler. 
Meaning, a variable is created when it's first assigned to something. 
Baabnq is a typeless language, which means that variables are not created with a type and are always 16-bit ( 0 - 65535 ) unsigned integers.
    </p>


    <h2>Output</h2>
    <h3>Print</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
print 100;
put _a = 200;
print _a;
</pre>
    <p>
The "print" command takes a variable or a constant and outputs it to stdout as an unsigned decimal integer. 
So as a result, the program above will print the following to the stdout:
    </p>
<pre class="embed">
100
200
</pre>

    <h3>Putchr</h3>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
putchr 10;
</pre>
    <p>
The "putchr" command also takes a variable or a constant, but it outputs the corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicode character</a>. 
So the above program would output a line feed.
    </p>

    <h2>Input</h2>
<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
input _a;
input _b;
</pre>
    <p>
The "input" command reads an unsigned decimal integer from stdin and writes it to the specified variable.
    </p>
