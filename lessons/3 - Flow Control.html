    <h1>Lesson 3 - Flow Control</h1>

    <p>
Flow Control in Baabnq is done with labels, which define specific points in a program and jumps to those labels. 
    </p>

<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
lab loop;
jump loop;
</pre>

    <p>
Consider the example above. 
A label called "loop" is defined and is then jumped to, which makes the program loop infinitely. 
Jumps can also be performed based on a condition to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop">for loops</a>:
    </p>

<pre class="embed baabnq-source">
put _i = 0;
lab loop;
    put _i = _i + 1;
jump loop ~ _i < 10;
</pre>

    <p>
A Tilde "~" is used to attach a condition to the jump statement.
