    <p>
      I don't intend for this to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121025045227/www.btinternet.com/~btketman/tutpage.html">personal autobiographical</a> or 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIS-100">immersively fictional</a> programmatic learning experience, 
      but i do wish to congratulate you on making it through the core features. Good job, have a cat picture:

    <h4>Now, a bit about the Philosophy of Baabnq</h4>
    <p>
        Baabnq's philosophy is generally one of simplicity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(computing)">minimalism</a>.
        Minimalism not only in the design of the language but also in the practice of using it.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        It tries to avoid the trap of excessive abstraction and overengineering that a lot of modern software falls into.
        Abstraction and related polymorphisms are powerful tools, but they can blind you and distract you from your goal.
        (Hope that didn't sound too religious / self-improvement-ish).
        Baabnq allows the utilization of abstractions, but it actively exposes the mechanisms used to achieve those abstractions.
        This makes the programmer aware of the immediate reality and consequences of their abstraction.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        This philosophy of minimal abstraction also applies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">types</a>.
        Formally, baabnq is an untyped language, meaning that it doesn't provide any build-in features for assigning types to data.

        <br>
        If you want a simple explanation of what types are, refer to <a href="/extra/types.html">this</a>.
                    
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Types and abstractions are closely related, especially in paradigms like 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming</a>,
        where object structures fulfil the same purpose of giving data meaning.
        
        <br>
        While baabnq is an untyped language, it still has strategies for making programs meaningful, aside from label and variable names.
        The two main ones are Routines Signatures and Naming Conventions, which will both be covered in the next lessons.
